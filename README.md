I am a software developer and am enthusiastic about the potential of artificial intelligence (AI). Currently, I am focused on implementing and evaluating deep learning AI models in Python for processing mass spectrometry to identify molecular signatures. Additionally, I am working on automating websites, games, and mobile applications in my free time.

I am also learning Java, React, and NextJS to expand my skill set. I am actively seeking opportunities to collaborate on projects that involve training intelligent agents to play video games. I am also seeking assistance training and deploying AI models on Punjabi datasets.

I would be happy to provide my expertise if you have any questions about programming, machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), or any other AI-related topics.

Apart from my work, I am keenly interested in gaming and enjoy keeping up with venture capitalism and the latest technological advancements and developments.
