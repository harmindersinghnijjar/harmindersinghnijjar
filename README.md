I'm a software developer and AI enthusiast working on web, game, and mobile application automation. I'm learning Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and looking to collaborate on training intelligent agents to play video games. I'm also seeking help training and deploying AI models trained on Punjabi datasets. 

Feel free to contact me if you have questions about programming, machine learning, computer vision, NLP, or anything related to AI. 

Outside work, I'm an avid gamer and enjoy learning new programming languages.
